# Open Physiology Model / Resource Manifest #

This library contains a complete formal description of the
Open Physiology model, as well as functionality to work with it.

_README.md is in the progress of being written_


## Installation

This library is written in ECMAScript 2015, with a few ES7 features thrown in.
The syntax can be processed with Babel 6, and you should import the
`babel-polyfill` package, which is not baked into this library.
